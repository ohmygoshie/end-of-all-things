    <h1 class="heading">The End of All Things</h1>
    <p class="intro">
        Now, I know what you're wondering. What is this? Why a website?
        Well, I have answers. This is a suicide note. It's a website because it's 
        easier to access and cooler in my opinion. Even when I'm dying, I have
        to be cool I guess. Honestly, I don't even know where to start. I just want to die,
        simply put. My life has been falling apart for a year and a half now and I cant
        take it anymore. I don't feel like straight up explaining why I want to die, so this 
        is going to be more of a goodbye note to everyone who is or was in my life that I 
        believe was important (excluding my family).

        Hey, Noor. I know you're one of the people who will actually read this and I appreciate
        it. Actually, I appreciate you. You've always been there for me through all of it.
        From rock bottom, to the top, to somewhere in the middle, you've always been there.
        You've talked me off a ledge more than the average person should have to. Ever since,
        what was it? 7th grade. You've been there. I have nothing but good things to say about you.
        I truly think you'll have a great life and you'll do great things. You have something
        special that not many people have. I know you'll get through my death, as thats what you 
        do. You make it through whatever is thrown at you. I've always envied your ability to stay
        strong in the face of adversity. Honestly, there's not much more to say. So, goodbye friend.
     </p>

    <p class="desc">
        Hey, Ouzman. You were a good friend. I mean that. I know we've sort of fallen out of
        touch recently. You found new friends and I've fallen deeper and deeper down the hole 
        I dug myself. I accept it, however. You have to make a life for yourself. It was always 
        one of your goals to be popular and you've done it. I'm happy for you. I just wished we
        talked a little more before my time to go. I've shared many great memories with you
        and I value every one of them. From hitting your head on a table to threatening me in lazer
        tag. There were times when you were there for me and I appreciate that. Again, I'm sorry we
        didn't stay in touch in my later years. So, adios amigo. Keep slinging patties at McDonalds 
        and running for hours on end. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="name">Sara</h2>
    <p class="desc">
        Hey, Sara. I want to thank you for being there for me throughout middle school. You were a
        great friend to me despite me being a massive shithead. I have always appreciated that.
        Eventually, though, we fell out of touch and from my perspective you began to dislike me.
        I understand why though, as again, I was a massive shithead. Overall, I just want to thank
        you for making me want to be a better person. You were a great role model.
    </p>
    <h2 class="name">Sam</h2>
    <p class="desc">
        Sam. You were awesome. I mean that. You were the best first girlfriend I could've asked for.
        Unfortunately our relationship just ran it's course. After that we fell out of touch, but 
        I cherish the memories I had with you. It wasn't a completely awful two years. You helped me
        realize what I wanted from a relationship.Not only that, but you taught me what love was.
        There have been times since that I wished I hadn'tended things with you, but I acknowledge 
        it was for the best. I wish you hapiness with Quinn and I hope you have a great life.
    </p>
    <h2 class="name">Tommy</h2>
    <p class="desc">
        Tommy, you most definitely aren't reading this and we haven't talked in a long while. I don't
        expect this to get to you, but I want you to know that despite how we fell out of touch, you
        were important to me for a time. I feel like we really bonded for a while in middle school. Until
        some really petty argument that made you distance yourself from me. It was about whether America
        was the worst country. That argument and the actions that followed was one of the worst moments of
        my life. It made me realize that most everyone wasn't there for me. It made me realize that I had 
        to change. After our argument, everyone took your side and kind of left me in the dust. That was
        when I knew I was a bad person. So, Tommy, I thank you for the connection we had at first, and for 
        eventually opening my eyes to my own character.
    </p>
    <h2 class="name">Elena</h2>
    <p class="desc">
        Hey Elena, even though we haven't known each other for long, you made me realize one thing. That I'm 
        not alone. You showed me that there are genuinely good people out there in shitty situations. You made
        me doubt whether or not I deserved what I was going through and almost changed my mind. You're a
        genuinely sweet person who deserves hapiness.
    </p>
    <h2 class="name">Autumn</h2>
    <p class="desc">
        Hey Autumn, I hope this finds you on a good day. We got close over the past couple months and I am very 
        thankful for us meeting. You're a great person with a bright future. Talking to you always brightened up
        my day. You get the trophy for having the absolute fastest response time of anyone I've talked to. You 
        showed me that I can depend on other people to be there when I need them and I thank you for that. I want
        you to know that you are enough, despite what you may believe. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="name">Nicole</h2>
    <p class="desc">
        Hey, Nikki. Funny seing you here. You're one of the few people I could really trust in this life.
        I feel like we had a lot of similarities and chemistry. We made great friend and tried dating, but 
        that didn't go so well. You taught me that not everything is black and white. Not everything is right
        or wrong. You made me think that maybe I could still be a good person despite the mistakes I've made. 
        Before I go, I want you to know that I hope you live out a full life. I don't want you to los to 
        yourself, like I did. I know you have a bright future with hapiness and all. Just hold on for a little
        longer.
    </p>
    <h2 class="name">Naila</h2>
    <p class="desc">
        Hey Naila. I don't expect you to read this nor really care that I've died. You made it pretty clear 
        that you wanted nothing to do with me. Unfortunately, the paragraph for the one person who cares the least
        is also going to be the longest. I loved you, simply put. I thought you were my soulmate. The time I spent 
        with you were the best moments in my life. Up until the day you broke up with me. I was destroyed. It was
        like I died that day and haven't been alive since. Because of the breakup, I was ready to end my life, but 
        I held on for the chance that once I got out of a mental hospital you'd give me a second chance. When I got 
        out however, you acted like you didn't care. You treated me like I didn't matter, so I blew up and we went
        no contact for months. Those months were miserible without you. Eventually, once school started again, you 
        tried to talk to me again, and I thought maybe just maybe we could salvage what we had, but no. The truth is,
        you were the last person in my life that I loved. Once you were gone, I knew that I had nothing left to hold
        onto. That's a big part of why I'm here now. I have nothing left.
    </p>
    <h2 class="name">Final Goodbye</h2>
    <p class="desc">
        So, this is it. The final goodbye. As I stated before, I have nothing left to live for. My life has been 
        over for a while and I'm just now pulling the plug. I'll miss some of the memories I've made, but I wont 
        miss life. Goodbye everyone.
